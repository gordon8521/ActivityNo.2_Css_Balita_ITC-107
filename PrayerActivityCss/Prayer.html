        <h1>Adamsonian's Prayer</h1> 
       <justified style="color: black;"> 
           Dear Lord,<br>
           Teach me the things that are important:<br>
           To be generous with Your gifts,<br>
           Compassionate to those who have less,<br>
       </justified>
           <justified style ="color:black;">
               Just in the face of unfair circumstances,<br>
               True when the world's values contradict my own,<br>
               Gracious when things don't go my way,<br>
               And magnanimous when they do.<br>
           </justified>
       <justified style="color: black;"> 
            May nothing else matter<br>
            Except Faith in Your goodness, my neighbor's, and mine,<br>
            Hope that things can get better,<br>
            And Charity that always sets things right.<br>
       </justified>
            <justified style="color: black;"> 
                May Your special Love for the Poor,<br>
                The mark of my uniquely Vincentian education,<br>
                Be the work I excel in,<br>
                The standard I constantly refer to,<br>
                And my courage when I meet You someday.<br>
            </justified>
        <justified style="color: black;"> 
            <br>
            O Mary conceived without sin,<br>
            Pray for us who have recourse to thee.<br>
            St. Vincent de Paul, Pray for us.<br>
        </justified>
